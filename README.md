# TF_data
Select data from arXiv: 2009.09119

Includes [MP-Gadget](https://github.com/sbird/MP-Gadget3) parameter files for Main, Small Box, and Low Res simulations with both a single and separate transfer functions

Data, for each of the above simulations, includes flux and matter power spectra at redshifts: 2, 3, 4, 5, & 6
For the Main simulations, the unscaled flux power is included as well as the species specific (DM and baryon) power at redshifts 2 & 6
